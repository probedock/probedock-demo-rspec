# probedock-demo-rspec

> Demo of integration with [Probe Dock](https://github.com/probedock/probedock) and [Probe Dock RT](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-rt) for RSpec.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.1.4+

## Setup and usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Run `bundle install`

3. If already registered, skip this step. Do the [registration](http://) on the demo server and create your account. You will receive an email confirmation with a link. 

4. Create the project in your organization on Probe Dock. First, access the projects' page and click on the `Add a new project` button. You can use the name `rspec-sandbox` for example for both name and display name. You can leave the description empty for the demo.

5. Once the project is created, you should follow the `Getting started` guide to setup your project. The guide will invite you to setup your main configuration file and the project configuration file. For this project, you must place the file `probedock.yml` in `<projectRootFolder>` folder. 

6. Now, you can run the test via maven with `rake`. You will see test results on Probe Dock on the dashboard. You are able to see the result details by clicking on the report line. 

9. Now you can play a bit with the tests. Break some tests and see the results on both interfaces. Play with the `probedock: { ... }` in the tests. You can also read the documentation of [Probe Dock RSpec](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-rspec) for more details about the probe used to send the test results. You have also several information on the [library](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-ruby) used by the probe. Finally, you will find the list of probes and libraries on this page: [Probe Dock Probes](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-probes).
